\description{
The murder data set contains information 
about the relative number of murders in American cities. 
It also contains further socio-economic information, such 
as a cityâ€™s unemployment rate, and the percentage of 
inhabitants with a low income. This data set should only 
be used for illustration. No further real-world conclusions 
should be drawn from the data, as it is entirely fictitious.
